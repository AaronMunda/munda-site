        </header>

        <article class="content animate delay-2">
            <p>Being a parent is my favorite job and easily the topic I enjoy talking about most. I've spent a lot of time thinking about the guidance I'd offer to new families that goes beyond conventional advice, and these are the points that have consistently resonated with friends as they've had their first kids. These are reflections from our experience. Every family is different, but this is what worked for us.</p>

            <h2>What I'd tell new parents:</h2>

            <p><strong>1. Treat parenting as a team sport, and revisit the plan often</strong><br>
            Before the baby arrives, talk explicitly about how you'll partner, especially around night feeds and daytime coverage. Avoid absolutes or performative goals (like "I'll change every single diaper") and instead aim for arrangements that actually work in practice. Revisit these plans early and often as reality sets in and needs change. Contributions are never truly equal, especially given the physical sacrifice and dependency involved in early motherhood, so focus on what is genuinely supportive.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Build toward being fully capable on your own</strong><br>
            Being able to handle a full night or full day solo (bedtime, changes, leaving the house, appointments) should be a short-term goal, not something you expect to master immediately. Work toward it intentionally so that if your partner needs to travel, rest, or step away for a day, you can genuinely hold things down. This capability allows you to give real, extended breaks rather than partial relief. Over time, it becomes a major source of trust and stability in your relationship.</p>

            <p><strong>3. As a dad, find something you fully own</strong><br>
            Early on, it's easy for dads to feel lost or unsure where they fit, especially when feeding and early bonding naturally center around moms. Find one thing you fully own. Something you can do confidently without asking questions or seeking guidance. For me, this was the back half of the nighttime routine: rocking to sleep after feeding and massage, plus the dream feed. Owning a clear role builds confidence, creates continuity, and helps you form your own identity as a father.</p>

            <p><strong>4. Routines matter more than you think</strong><br>
            Consistent routines help kids build familiarity and feel safe, especially around naps, meals, and bedtime. Nighttime routines should feel clearly distinct from nap routines since nighttime sleep is longer and more consolidated. Changes like time zone shifts, starting daycare, or introducing a nanny can be disruptive. Expect some short periods of difficulty during transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>5. Find community before you think you need it</strong><br>
            Before the baby is even born, look for mommy-and-me groups, parenting circles, or baby classes. These often include yoga or exercise, child development education, and space to talk openly with other parents. It's especially helpful when babies are born around the same time, since everyone is navigating similar stages. For us, these groups became real community and lasting friendships.</p>

            <p><strong>6. Early parenting feels high-stakes, but it usually isn't</strong><br>
            In the early days, everything feels urgent and consequential, but most of the time it's probably fine and not as big of a deal as it feels. You're going through a massive life change while learning an entirely new role in real time. Give yourself grace and lower the bar. Confidence and calm arrive sooner than you expect.</p>
